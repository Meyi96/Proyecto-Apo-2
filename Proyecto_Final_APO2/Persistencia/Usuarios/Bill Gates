Considering the impact Silicon Valley has on our lives, I’m surprised how rarely pop culture gets it right. To understand how it works today, you should watch @SiliconHBO. Personally, I identify most with Richard Hendricks: https://b-gat.es/2Q4IEnO

Climate change may be the toughest problem humanity has ever faced — but it's solvable. Washington has a unique opportunity to lead the way as a hub for innovation on clean energy. I urge you to vote yes on 1631. Ballots must be in the mail by Tuesday.
