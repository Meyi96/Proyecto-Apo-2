Often Politicians tell us lies we want to hear rather than truths we need to know — leaving one to ask whether they should be followers of our desires or leaders of our needs.

Jet Engine Car. Rode it down a 3-mile runway with Jay for @lenosgarage. Driver-side window blew out at 130 mph. We hit 165. Could have gone 200+, but Jay said he didn’t want to be the guy… https://www.instagram.com/p/BkqQ-pLgMu6/?utm_source=ig_twitter_share&igshid=15uo85ko4l0bt …

Most of Star Wars bears no correspondence with any branch of science or engineering — a universe where the known laws of physics sit far, far away.

So don’t sweat it. But when your daughter writes her first SciFi novel, we will all look forward to reading it. https://twitter.com/notsnape/status/1012109158827503616 …

Happy June Solstice to all residents of planet Earth: Longest day of the year for north of the equator. Shortest for south of the equator. And for Equatorians, same old boring 12-hour day, just like every other day of the year.
