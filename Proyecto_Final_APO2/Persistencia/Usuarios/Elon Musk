Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceship/upper stage & Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earth�s deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons)

Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive.

Makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for �grant money�. They earn ? vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible?
