Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceship/upper stage & Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earth’s deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons)

Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive.

I took delivery of a flawless @tesla Performance Model 3 this week. My review: crisp acceleration and so solid... oh screw that, this thing is sex on wheels, @elonmusk! So much fun! For anyone test driving one: it’s all about the freeway on ramps and twisty roads. $TSLA
