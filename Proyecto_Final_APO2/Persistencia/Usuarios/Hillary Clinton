Of course, combating climate change is about more than dollars and cents. It's a moral imperative. Our children and grandchildren deserve to live on a planet that can support their lives, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.

In Europe, nationalists like Hungary’s Viktor Orban are exploiting this challenge to stoke fear and resentment. To defeat them and protect democracy, the EU needs a more comprehensive policy that builds societies that are both secure and welcoming.

On both sides of the Atlantic, we need reform. Not open borders, but immigration laws enforced with fairness and respect for human rights. We can’t let fear or bias force us to give up the values that have made our democracies both great and good.

We passed bipartisan comprehensive reform when I was a senator, but House Republicans killed it. Since then, the GOP has refused to make progress and instead uses the issue to divide our country.
